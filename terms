Terms of Service — Ashuzone

Last updated: October 2025

1. Introduction

Welcome to Ashuzone ("we", "us", or "our"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Ashuzone application (the "App"), which integrates with TikTok via the TikTok Developer APIs to automate video uploads and publishing. By using the App you accept and agree to these Terms.

2. Services Provided

Ashuzone allows users to connect a TikTok account via OAuth and to upload and publish videos to TikTok through automated workflows (for example, using n8n). The App only interacts with TikTok through the scopes and APIs authorized by the user.

3. Required Permissions and Scopes

To operate, the App requests permissions from your TikTok account. These may include:

video.upload — to upload video files to TikTok on your behalf

video.publish — to publish uploaded videos to your TikTok account

user.info.basic — to obtain basic account information for linking and display

You must grant these permissions to use the App’s publishing and automation features.

4. User Responsibilities and Content Ownership

You are responsible for all content you upload, publish, or schedule using the App.

You must have the legal right to publish any content (videos, audio, images, text) you submit.

You agree not to use the App to upload content that violates TikTok’s Terms of Service, community guidelines, or applicable law.

5. Account Access & Revocation

You may revoke the App’s access to your TikTok account at any time from your TikTok account settings. Revoking access may stop scheduled or automated publishing.

We may suspend or terminate access to the App if you violate these Terms or misuse the TikTok platform.

6. Data Collection & Use (Summary)

The App may store basic TikTok profile information (username, user ID), video metadata, and usage logs necessary to run automation tasks.

We use this data only to authenticate, upload/publish videos, manage workflows, and improve service.

We do not collect TikTok passwords. OAuth tokens and credentials are handled and stored securely.

(For full details, please see our Privacy Policy.)

7. Third-Party Services

The App relies on TikTok APIs and may integrate with other third-party services (for example, n8n, hosting providers). Use of those services is subject to their terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for third-party service behavior.

8. Disclaimer & Limitation of Liability

The App is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, whether express or implied, including fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement.

We are not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the App, including loss of content or business interruption.

9. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. We will post the updated Terms with a revised "Last updated" date. Continued use of the App after changes means you accept the new Terms.

10. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws applicable to the operator of the App. Any disputes will be handled in accordance with those laws.
